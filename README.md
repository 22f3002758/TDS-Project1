* **Approach:** The file `GitHub_scrapper.ipynb` facilitates the GitHub data collection process, utilizing the `GitHub REST API` with authentication via a personal token to gather     profiles of users located in `Beijing` with over `500 followers`. It collects professional details and repositories, manages API rate limits efficiently, and          exports the organized data into two CSV files: `users.csv` and `repositories.csv`.

* **Interesting Insights:** The data shows striking contrasts in `Number of Repositories` and `Stargazers_Count`. While `LinuxSuRen` has the most repositories `1,842`, `521xueweihan` achieved the highest star count `133,337` with just `145` repos. This suggests that focusing on fewer, high-quality projects can generate more community interest than maintaining many repositories.

* **Recommendation:** Based on the above analysis, it is recommended that developers focus on targeting trending technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Emphasis should also be placed on maintaining strong documentation practices, as well as strategically selecting projects that align with current market demands. This approach is suggested as an alternative to maintaining multiple repositories, as it is likely to result in higher engagement on the platform.
