The file `GitHub_scrapper.ipynb` facilitates the GitHub data collection process, utilizing the `GitHub REST API` with authentication via a personal token to gather profiles of users located in `Beijing` with over `500 followers`. It collects professional details and repositories, manages API rate limits efficiently, and exports the organized data into two CSV files: `users.csv` and `repositories.csv`.
